               DOCUMENTATION FOR THE ASSEMBLER EDITOR
                      by Kip Irvine, 2/94
                   enhanced by Jens Guld, 9/94

                            INTRODUCTION

This editor was created using Borland Turbo Vision (tm) as a
multi-window popup editor for Kip Irvine's "Assembly Language 
for the IBM-PC", 2nd Edition, 1993, Macmillan publishing Co., 
ISBN 0-02-359651-1.

You are welcome to use and distribute this editor free of charge.
You may not sell the editor for profit without the written consent
of Kip Irvine. 

You should be able to use this editor with any assembler of your
choice. I have tested it with Borland TASM versions 3.2 and 4.0, 
and Microsoft MASM 5.1  There are installation options that let 
you set the name and path of the assembler, linker, debugger, 
and link library (if any).

Enhancements for Version 1.20:

1. The FILE / SAVE AS command automatically appends an extension 
   of ASM.
2. If the configuration file (AE.CFG) is not found in the current
   directory, the program will look for it in AE.EXE's home 
   directory.
3. If the path for the assembler, linker, or debugger is
   incorrect, a message box notifies you of the problem.
4. You can choose three modes for display: color, monochrome,
   or black&white. The monochrome option is well suited to
   LCD panels and laptop computers.

.....................................................................
When you see something like <Esc> in the following text it means that you
should press the Esc key. <Ctrl-Y> means that you should press the Control
key and hold it down while you press the "Y" key.  <Ctrl-Q-Y> means that
you should press the Control key and hold it down while you first press "Q"
and then "Y".

In a menu you can choose an option by clicking it or pressing the marked
letter in it.

<<<<..........................WARNING!...............................>>>>
Although you can have the same text file in two windows and write
in both of them, AE assumes the contents of the two windows to be two
different files.  This means that a change in one window is not reflected in
the other. So if you have changed the text in both windows and then save
them, one window will overwrite the other.

                           SCREEN TEST, TAKE ONE
                           ---------------------

Run the editor by typing its name and an optional name of
a file to be edited (you can enter the name of only one text file).
A default extension of ASM is assumed. Examples:

          AE                 ; no file being edited
          AE prog1           ; edits prog1.asm 
          AE myfile.dta      ; edits myfile.dta

The first time you start AE, you will probably see a blue striped screen.
Press <F10> and then <F> or <Alt-F> or place the mouse cursor on the word
"File" in the top line and press the left mouse button (AE only uses the
left button).  You will then see a pulldown menu:

The two first options are "Open" and "New". "Open" gives you a dialogue
window with the names af any ASM files in the current directory.  If you
wish to see files with extensions other than ".ASM" you must enter a name
with the appropriate wild card(s).  If you decide not to select anything
in the menu, exit with <Esc> or by clicking the mouse outside the menu.

The current directory is the directory from which AE was started and not
necessarily the directory in which AE is placed.  You can select a file by
first clicking the file name with the mouse and then the "Open" button.
Or you can doubleclick the file name.  You start a new text file by clicking
the "Name" field in the top of the window and then entering the new file
name in it.  This gets you a text window in a window frame.  The file name
is written in the top of the frame.  If you have no mouse you can go between
the "Name" and the "Files" fields with <Alt-N> and <Alt-F>. You move
around the Files field with the cursor and select with <Enter>.  You may
open multiple edit windows, each with a different source file if you wish.
 
Choosing "New" also gives you a window with a border.  In the top
of the border you will see the name "Untitled".  This name can be changed
by clicking "File" at the top of the screen and choosing "Save as".
This opens a dialogue window in the top of which you will see an empty
field.  If you only enter the file name it will be placed in the current
directory.  If you write a PATH before the file name, the file will be
placed in the directory the PATH points to.

Be sure to save the file before assembling it. Beginning with version 1.20,
a default extension of ASM is added to the name you choose.
In the "File" menu you will find several ways to save a text file to disk:

Save
You choose it by clicking it or by pressing <S> on the keyboard.  The text
is saved and you can continue writing.  You can also press <F2> without
entering the menus.  If you wish to save the text and remove the file from
memory you must use <Alt-F3> or click the small green square in the text
window's top left corner.

Save As
This brings forth a dialogue window.  In the top of the window there is a
field with the current PATH and file name.  To name a new file you write
the name and click OK.  To save the file to a new directory you must first
go to the directory with the Change Dir option and then save the file.

Exit
Exits the current file(s).  You get the opportunity to save any changes.


Dialogue Windows
----------------
At this point we should discuss dialogue windows.  When you choose an option
in the menus, a dialogue window frequently opens on the screen.  Let us use
the "Open" window in the "File" menu as an example:

The "Open" menu is used to open a previous file or to start and name new
text files.  In the top left of the window there is a little green square.
Clicking it exits the window and you return to the text.  Beneath the square
there is a line where a new file name can be entered.  If you want an old
file, you can find the file name in the window below and click it. If you
have no mouse, move to the Files window with <Alt-F> and go to the file name
with the cursor keys.  You return to the Name field with <Alt-N>.  If there
are many files in the directory, you cannot see them all.  To see the unseen
files you should first go to the Files window and then press the right
arrow key.  Or you can click the right arrow beneath the window or click on
the bar between the two arrows in the bottom line, hold the mouse button
down and draw the mouse in the desired direction.  A file can be chosen by
clicking it.  The file name will appear in the Name field in the top of the
window (where you see the *.ASM in the diagram above).  You can also choose
a file by double clicking it (two clicks rapidly after one another).  If you
decide not to open a file after all, you can exit the window by clicking the
little green square in the top left of the window or by pressing <Esc> or
by clicking "Cancel" to the right in the window. If you have made several
selections, you can see the older choices by clicking the small down arrow
to the right of the Name field or by pressing the <DownCursor>. (This arrow 
is not in the diagrams of this manual because it will not print correctly 
on a printer.)

A small dialogue window opens where you can choose one of the older names 
by double clicking.  When you have chosen a name, you will be returned to 
the previous window where the name will appear in the filename field. At 
the bottom of the "Open" window you will see the filename and the
size of the file plus the current date, year and time.


                           SCREEN TEST - TAKE TWO
                           ----------------------

When you have started AE and have some text on the screen, the edit
window will be surrounded by a border which is white at the top and to the
left but light blue to the right and at the bottom.  At the top and at the
bottom of the screen there are white lines with some text. The top line is
the Menu Line.  The bottom screen line is a help line with information about
the most important keyboard commands.  At the bottom of the text window you
will see the Edit Status line.  If the text has been modified, an asterix
"*" appears in it.  The current line and column will also be indicated
(line:col).

Most of these functions have been described in the section SCREEN TEST,

This enables you to edit text outside the AE directory.  You choose the
function and then see a directory tree in which you can move around by
clicking.  You select a directory by clicking it or clicking the ChDir button
to the right in the window.  The desired directory is seen in the Directory
Name field at the top of the window and you go to it by clicking the OK
button to the right.  You can also enter the name of the desired directory
from the keyboard and click the OK box.  If you have no mouse you can move
between the Directory Name and Directory Tree fields with <Alt-N> and
<Alt-T>.  If you decide not to change directory you can return to the
original directory and PATH name by clicking "Revert" to the right in the
window.  To save a text in a new directory you must change to the new
directory.  Then you use "Save As".


Shell To Dos
This option is used if you want to leave AE briefly in order to use a DOS
command or a program.  You return to AE by writing "EXIT" and pressing
<Enter>.

The only way to exit the clipboard is by clicking the little green square
in the top left of the window.  <Esc> won't work.  If you have no mouse the
way to get out is to press <F6> which will take you to one of the other
windows (and eventually back to the Clipboard).  The only way to get
completely rid of the Clipboard window without a mouse is to exit AE
completely with <Alt-X>.


Clear  <Ctrl-Del> or <Del>
Erases marked text.  The erased text is NOT placed in the clipboard.  A text
block can be marked with the mouse or by placing the cursor on the first
character of the text block, holding <Shift> down and moving the cursor to

A dialogue window is opened where you can enter the search word or string.
You can also check off boxes to indicate if AE should search for the text
exactly as entered or should ignore upper case while searching.  If you
choose "Case sensitive" by clicking the box to the left of it "miller" will
not find "Miller" or "MILLER".  If the box has not been checked, "miller"
will find "Miller" and "MILLER".  Without a mouse you can toggle "Case
sensitive" on and off with <Alt-C>.

Choosing "Whole words only" means that only strings delimited by spaces
will be found.  "miller" won't find "miller's" or "miller.".  A word in
double quotes will not be found.  If the box has not been checked "miller"
will find "miller", "miller's" and "miller.".  Without a mouse you can

ASSEMBLE  <F9>
--------

If you have more than one window open, set the focus to the window
containing the program you want to assemble.  You may do this by 
pressing F6 to cycle through the windows to the desired one, or 
click the mouse in the window you want.

Choose ASSEMBLE from the RUN menu or enter <F9>.  The assembler will take 
over the screen until it is finished.  Press a key to return to 
the editor.  If there were any errors or warnings, the editor will 
remind you by displaying a dialog box with the error code number 
returned by the assembler (this is the same as the ErrorLevel 
number returned to a batch file).

LINK
----

Set the focus to the window containing the program you want to 
link.  If you are linking a multi-module program, the window 
should contain the program's main module.  Choose LINK from the 
RUN menu.  You will be prompted by a dialog for the names of 
any link modules; if this is a single-module program, just press 
Enter.

If there are other modules to be linked to the current program, 
type their names with a space between each.  Press Enter.

The linker will also attempt to link the link library file to 
your program, in case you have specified any external modules 
(using the EXTRN directive).  If you have the book by Irvine, 
the library would be CONSOLE.LIB.  There are directions on selecting 
a link library in the section SET PATHNAMES below.

If your program doesn't use any external routines, 
the link library will just be ignored by the linker.

Version 4.0 of Borland's TASM ignores the DOSSEG directive. If
any of your old source files contain DOSSEG, the linker will
issue a warning message.  If you get this error message from 
Irvine's CONSOLE.LIB, download the version dated 2/12/94 or later
from the Borland Compuserve forum.

DEBUG
Run your linked program with the debugger.

RUN
You can run your linked program just as is by choosing the 
RUN command from the RUN menu. Or, you can run your program 
with the debugger, by selecting DEBUG from the RUN menu.

PARAMETERS
If you want to pass parameters to your program, select the
PARAMETERS option from the RUN menu.

SET PATHNAMES
The editor is shipped with a default configuration file (AE.CFG)
containing sample pathnames for the assembler, editor, linker, and
link library. Notice that you must include the extensions with the
executable filenames, but not with the link library name. No doubt
you will want to change these to suit your own directory setup:

  Assembler path:   C:\TASM\TASM.EXE
         options:   /z/zi
     Linker path:   C:\TASM\TLINK.EXE
         options:   /v
   Debugger path:   C:\TASM\BIN\TD.EXE
    Library path:   C:\TASM\CONSOLE

(The CONSOLE.LIB file is supplied on a disk with the Irvine book,
and is available in the Borland Turbo assembler forum on 
Compuserve.)

To change these paths, select the SET PATH NAMES option from 
the RUN menu.  All changes are saved when exiting the editor. 
The AE.CFG file is saved in the current directory, so if you're 
working in various directories, copy AE.CFG to each directory.

If version 1.20 of this editor doesn't find AE.CFG in the current
directory, it will use the one found in the home directory of
AE.EXE.  Failing to find a configuration file there, it will
create a new one.
  
SET VIDEO MODE
Here you can choose between color, black&white and monochrome.

<<<<WARNING!>>>>
Although you can have the same text file in two windows and write
in both of them, AE assumes the contents of the two windows to be two
different files.  This means that a change in one window is not reflected in
the other. So if you have changed the text in both windows and then save
them, one window will overwrite the other.

Size/move  <Ctrl-F5>
A text window's size, shape and position on the screen can be changed. AE
can several files in menory at a time and you can choose between
seeing them all on the screen simultaneously (Tile) or having them placed
one behind the other (Cascade).

A window can be moved around the screen by placing the mouse cursor on the
window's top border and holding the mouse button down while the window is
moved to the desired location with the mouse.  You can enlarge or diminish a
window by placing the mouse on the window's lower right corner after which
you hold down the button and move the corner to the desired place.  A window
can be closed by clicking the little green square in the window frame's top
left corner. By clicking the arrow in the top right window frame you can
toggle between having a text file covering the whole screen or only part of
the screen.

The size, shape and location of a text window can be changed without the
mouse by choosing Resize/Move or with <Ctrl-F5>.  You move the window with
the cursor keys and change the size and shape with the Shift-cursor keys.
When you are finished, press <Enter>.  If you decide to change nothing,
press <Esc>.

Zoom   <F5>
Toggles between one window and all windows appearing on the screen.
Or click "F5" in the bottom screen line.

Tile
Shows all text windows simultaneously.

Cascade
Places text windows one behind the other.

Next   <F6>
Moves the user to the next text file.  From the bottom file, you will be
moved to the top file, and from the closest file you will be moved to
rearmost file.  You can also click "F6" in the screen's bottom line.

Previous  <Shift-F6>
Moves the user to the previous text file.  If you are in the top file, you
will go to the bottom file and if you are in the rearmost you will go to the
file in front.

Close  <Alt-F3>
Closes a text window.  If text has been changed, you will get the
opportunity to save it.


HELP LINE
---------
The screen's bottom line gives information about the function keys:

  F1 Help   F2 Save   F3 Open   Alt-F3   F5 Zoom  F6 Next  F10 Menu

You can call these functions by clicking the names in the help line.



                              KEYBOARD COMMANDS
                              -----------------

So far we have mostly concerned ourselves with mouse commands but the
keyboard commands should not be neglected.

DELETE TEXT
-----------
<Del> and <Backspace> function normally.

<Ctrl-Q-H> deletes from the cursor to the left margin.

<CTRL-Q-Y> deletes from the cursor to the end of the line.

<CTRL-Y> deletes the text on the line the cursor is on.

<Del> deletes a marked text.


MOVING ABOUT IN THE TEXT
------------------------
The cursor keys function normally.  <Page Up> and <Page Down> move a
screen up or down.  <Home> and <End> move the cursor to the beginning and
end of the line.

You can go to the beginning or the end of the text with <Ctrl-PageUp> and
<Ctrl-PageDown>.

You can move the cursor to a new position by moving the mouse cursor to it
and pressing the left mouse button.

In the text window's right border you will see two arrows and a small bar.
If you place the mouse cursor on the up-arrow and press the left mouse
button you will go towards the beginning of the text.  If you do the same
with the down-arrow you will move towards the end of the text.  If you
place the mouse on the bar and drag it up or down you will move up or down
in the text.

To the right of the status line in the bottom of the text window there are
also a pair of arrows and a bar.  They can be used to move around in a line.

THE STATUS LINE
This is in the left side of the text windows bottom frame.  If there are
unsaved changes in the text, there will be an asterix (*).  You will also
see the cursors current position (line:col).


TABS
Pressing the Tab key inserts eight spaces.  If you then use <Backspace>,
all the tab spaces will be removed.  If you move into the Tab spaces with
the cursor keys the cursor will be moved to the beginning or end of the
spaces.

UNDO
<Ctrl-U> is the normal UNDO sequence.  The line is restored to what it was
before the cursor entered it.  If you have moved the cursor from the line
the changes can no longer be undone.
